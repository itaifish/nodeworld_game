# Nodeworld

This game is a homage to the videogame [edgeworld](https://edgeworld.fandom.com/wiki/Edgeworld_Wiki), with base building, factions, battling, and realtime building delays.

The backend and frontend is Typescript, bootstrapped with Create-T3-App. This includes Prisma, NextJS, NextAuth, and tRPC. The game client and animations are [as of 1/24/2023 not implemented yet] in phaser3.
